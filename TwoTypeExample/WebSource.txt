This is an addition of another form type to the SQLiteSample example located https://github.com/b12kab/SQLiteSample

This was created to show the problems of sqlite-net-pcl under iOS with these errors:
2019-06-19 20:31:27.159964-0400 PTTracker.iOS[3698:244528] [logging] API call with invalid database connection pointer
2019-06-19 20:31:27.160134-0400 PTTracker.iOS[3698:244528] [logging] misuse at line 154344 of [95fbac39ba]

This happens when the destructor on the repository (located in Services) is destructed and the 
connection is disposed. It works without issue on Android.

The reason for how this exists here - instead of how it works under https://github.com/b12kab/SQLiteSample
is that the repository isn't testable with unit tests to validate the correct values are returning
as both iOS / Android have the dependency service to get and open the file. This won't work
on my Mac (or a PC) for unit testing.
